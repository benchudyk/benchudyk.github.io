description: "Hafler has a long legacy of power amps for hifi listening systems. The
  brand was purchased and several new products were developed. The logo was decided
  but I was in charge of branding and packaging. For the initial 6 products I created
  box, manuals and other print materials. As well as designed and assisted the development
  of the site. The website is a static HTML site using LESS and bootstrap for the
  responsive framework. \n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"www.hafler.com\">www.hafler.com</a></p>\n\n<img

description: "Acoustic panels for several different industries from home studios to
  restaurants. Primacoustic is a sister company to Radial Engineering that needed
  some serious updates. The final product uses wordpress for the CMS. I designed the
  site and helped with some front end development. I directed the team and reported
  to the owner for each stage of the process. There was roughly 250 pages and post
  types full of content so planning was key. We separated products as a post type
  so that we could manipulate the products for future apps like a room calculator
  and graphic price list. \r\n\r\n\r\n[www.primacoustic.com](http://www.primacoustic.com/)\r\n\r\n"
